This server uses the VentureChat plugin, which means it supports different types of channels. Think of it like the discord channels. If someone joins the same channel as you (in game and here in this discord server), they can only see and send the messages within that channel. But they want to chat globally, all they need to do is to switch it to the global channel. The same idea applies to this minecraft server as well. In order to change channels, just type in `/channel [insert channel name here]`. (the current ones are `global`, and `smp-economy`) By default, it's set the global channel, hence why there is a global channel here as well. This allows you to chat between the 2 different servers as well. And yes, this is the chat plugin that the discord srv config.yml file was referencing to (VentureChat)

On the discord server, you will notice 2 channels within the Main Chat section. And those are Global and SMP-Economy As mentioned before, these correspond with each of the VentureChat channels that are on the server.
